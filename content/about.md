I'm passionate about systems programming, distributed computing, and understanding the inner workings of large-scale software. I enjoy diving deep into source code, reading research papers, and uncovering the architectural and theoretical foundations behind technologies used at scale.

This site is a random space where I document how things work under the hood - from foundational papers like MapReduce to the design of real-world systems like databases, compilers, and networking stacks. I aim to bridge the gap between practice and theory by grounding these systems in their underlying mathematical principles - whether thatâ€™s algebra, logic, or category theory.

My writing usually come from notes I take while reading papers or reverse engineering systems. I try to:

- Trace high-level ideas down to their implementation  
- Highlight the algebra or formalism behind programming models  

## Languages

I program mainly in C++, Rust, Python and sometimes Bash.
