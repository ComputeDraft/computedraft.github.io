## Intro

This is not a guide on what internships are and that will recommend you neetcode to succeed. That is meaningless and any quick google search will tell you that.

Instead, I'm focusing on actually how to stand out. It's really important to differentiate yourself.


## Statistics

The top 10% of applicants receive around 40% percent of the available offers. This essentially translate to: if you want lots of offers, you need to be in the top.

As unintuitive as it may seem, getting into this 10% of people is actually trivial.


## Make Sure Your CV Is Solid

Despite maths and computer science being known for having smart students, you'd be surprised how many people can't produce a good piece of paper.

I have reviewed so many CVs over the past couple years, to the point where I repeatedly get messages from people about how they are starting to get interviews afterwards. The game is quite straightforward.

The first thing is having a solid template. Everyone recommends [Jake's resume template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs), which is pretty good if you are starting out and don't have too much experience or interesting projects. 

After a while you will need something more compact. This is my template, which I've adapted from a Cambridge student. A CV template alone won't make you a top applicant, but many of my friends use my template and have got great results.

Here are some
show examples of the templates here>

### CV Sections

#### Education
Education section should be at the top, and show your degree, university and the dates you are attending. Including the date is very important, as if you don't show a graduation date that meets the requirements of a job posting, you may be screened by default.the dates you are attending

If you are at university, don't bother showing you GCSE school and grades. Only include your A Levels if you have extra whitespace you need to fill, but in general this should not be included either.

University name matters - of course it does. However that doesn't mean that you can't go to a great company if you don't go to a great university. It just means you have to work harder, be more impressive on paper outside of your degree. It doesn't matter if you go to a non-russell group university if you are an international champion in xyz for example.

I have noticed that some people at lower universities outclass people from better ones, purely because of being comfortable and relying on prestiege to get roles. Even at top trading firms

#### Experience
Your experience section should show the previous jobs you've had. If you have had no tech jobs, then put a previous one that shows soft skills, i.e. working at a restaurant. I would probably limit this to only one job, as just showing off soft skills is not really relevant (there is no value added).

#### Projects
Your projects should show the languages, tools and frameworks you used to build them. If you have little experience or are still looking for your first internship, then you should maximise this section. Make your projects unique, have technical depth, and potentially something that fits the type of company you are applying for. You can use courseworks as projects - I've seen a lot of people do this - but ideally only if you don't have anything better to put on there.

The best projects usually come from building stuff from scratch, rather than relying on existing frameworks and tools. Although this also depends on the internship role you're applying for, i.e. a web development role would probably love if you live breathe react and nextjs.

#### Extra Section
Ideally you should have an extra section with anything impressive that you have done. It depends on what you've accomplished so far, but some example titles would be:
- Conferences and Research -
- Awards - List any awards you have, this could from hackathons, company challenges, university competitions, research competitions, etc

When starting out you may not need this section, but if you can fill it with a lot of relevant and impressive stuff, it might make a recruiter not have a chance but to move you to the next stage of the process.

For example, mine contains captaining a tech related team, open source contributions, a company award, an international conference, ...
